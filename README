Options operations simulator
----------------------------

The first release contains only simulations for covered writes
that are made exactly 30 days before expiration, and are always
carried until the last day. This particular covered write strategy
is useful to damp stock volatility and/or extract a steady income
from a long-term stock position.

The three executable scripts are:

simulavc.py

	Simulates a huge number of operations for a given
	scenario and prints the average return and volatility.

	Note that calculated return and volatility are averages
	over many, many individual operations; they represent
	what a long-term investor would get upon doing the operation
	many times over an extended amount of time.

h_vc.py:

	Simulation supervisor: creates a list of scenarios based
	on market variables, and calls simulavc.py for each 
	scenario, writing the result in a text file (data_vc.txt).

	This script can be safely stopped, and scenario variables
	can even be changed. Scenarios already simulated (and
	written to text file) are skipped. Also, several
	simulations can be spawned in parallel (useful in
	multi-core computers: using two cores will cut the total
	simulation time by half).

g_vc.py: 

	Simulation data graphic visualizer: for analysis of simulation
	results. Some filtering options are available, so the effect
	of each market variable can be pinpointed.

	Graphics are plotted using Tk, which is the most portable
	option for Python. The downside is ugliness.


Scenario variables
------------------

Both in h_vc.py script and the graphic visualizer, the scenario variables
can be seen, and we need to explain each one briefly.

K%: strike value as a percentage of spot. K=106% means that, for a stock
with spot value of $100, strike would be $106 (that is, 6% out-of-the-money).
For a stock with current value of $50, strike would be $53. And so on.

volvol%: "volatility of volatility". When this variable is bigger than
zero, the distribution of returns is a leptokurtosis instead of normal.
Unit is % of volatility. For example, if volatility is 30% and volvol
is 50%, it means that standard deviation of volatility is 15%; the
instantaneous volatility will fall between 15% and 45% twice in every
three samples.

riskpremium%: The risk premium of the stock. For example, if interest rate
is 9% and riskpremium is 150%, the instantaneous rate of return for the
stock is 13.5%. (Note that volatility will depress this, so the actual
rate of return would be lower.)

vol%: the volatility, expressed in %/year.

The interest rate is locked at 9% for all simulations.


Data format written to text file

Graphics format
---------------

Each scenario puts exactly six points in the graph, each one
with a different color:

Purple: Instantaneous rate of return of stock position
	plus covered write

Red: Rate of return of stock position + covered write
	(smaller than instantaneous return because of volatility)

Dark Orange: Instantaneous rate of return of the stock position

Olive: Rate of return of the stock position

Dark Green: Volatility of the stock position + covered write.

Blue: Volatility of the stock position

The most interesting points are the Red and Green ones, since they
tell the return rate and volatility for covered writes. The "raw"
stock position returns and volatilities are plotted just for
comparison and checking purposes.

X axis is the strike as a percentage of spot, but this can be changed;
just select another variable at the leftmost ("X axis") list.

Y axis may be rate of return or volatility (depending on point color),
both having %/year as unit. Left side shows scale for rate of return,
right side shows scale for volatilty.  Note that volatilities are 
always positive while rates of return may be negative.

At the bottom of graphics screen, the scenario variables are shown
as lists. Clicking in a specific value puts the respective scenarios
in evidence.
